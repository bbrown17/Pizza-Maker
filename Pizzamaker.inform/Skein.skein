Mamma mia! The world&apos;s most famous pizza chef, Pesto di Beppo, is coming to your restaurant in an hour and you still haven&apos;t made the pizza you promised him. You stand in the kitchen wondering what to do. North of the kitchen is a store filled with all kinds of gourmet foods and fancy supplies. West of the kitchen is your bedroom where you used to sleep every night after the restaurant closed. To your east is the dining room where you take special guests to enjoy your latest creations. Behind you is the restaurant, which is closed for the weekend.

    *** You did it! You have the perfect pizza to give to Pesto di Beppo. A few minutes later he arrives and begins eating right away. Despite pizza being the only thing served, he didn&apos;t complain, because pizza is the only thing he ate anyway. After complimenting the amount of sauce in the pizza, Pesto hands you a check.

&quot;This is for you&quot;, he says. &quot;Use it to make more pizza.&quot; Pesto di Beppo stands up out of his seat and heads to the door before turning around. He looks at you fondly and says, &quot;Mama mia, my brother.&quot; ***
