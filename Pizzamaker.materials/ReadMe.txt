The setting of the game takes place in the player’s restaurant. When the game begins, the player is in the Kitchen and can move to the dining area, bedroom, and store, which are all part of the restaurant.

One of the puzzles is finding out what the man in the Store wants. The player has to figure out what to ask the man about so that the man can help the player. I experimented with letting the player choose whether or not they take the items that would help them get what they want from the man instead of just giving the items to the player. The player also had to use clues around them, such as item names or certain items in a room, to figure out what it is they needed to do.

The game contains four rooms. The player begins in the Kitchen and from there can go North to the Store, East to the Dining Room, and West to the Bedroom. The objects in the Kitchen are a large box of spices, jars of spices, a jar of baking soda, a bottle of hot sauce, and a bottle of vinegar. The object in the Store is a pizza. The object in the Bedroom is a poster. The object in the Dining Room is a magazine. All of the rooms are also filled with scenery such as tables or other objects the player shouldn’t be able to add to their inventory.

While making this game, I learned how to add cover art to the release. First, I asked some of my classmates for help, but I still didn’t understand. I checked the source code of other games such as “Get That Cat” and “A Day for Spelling” but I was still confused. Finally, I asked Mr. Kiang (my teacher) for help and he directed me to the built-in Inform guide. I then understood where to put my files and what code to use after reading the instructions.

Mrs. Kiang’s website, Mr. Kiang, and the built-in Inform guide were extremely important in helping me to learn how to use Inform. I’d usually go to Mrs. Kiang’s website, informforstudents.wikispaces.com, before checking any other sources. The website was easy to search and open at all hours. The built-in Inform guide was very thorough just like Mrs. Kiang’s website, however, it was usually harder for me to navigate. Mr. Kiang was also available quite often and was able to help me with little bugs that were stopping my game’s progress and even fixing big problems such as not knowing what code to use to allow the player to win the game.
